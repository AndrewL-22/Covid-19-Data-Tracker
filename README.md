# Covid-19-Data-Tracker
This Python program collects and tracks COVID-19 data over a 3-week period. Users input daily data, including affected regions, symptoms, age range, and data sources. The program then logs this information into a text file (covid_data.txt) while identifying significant changes in trends over time.
